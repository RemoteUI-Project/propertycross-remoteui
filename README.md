# Propertycross RemoteUI

The RemoteUI App Framework allows you to build apps for Android, iOS, Windows, macOS and Linux. In this repository, you find the RemoteUI variant of the cross-platform app defined on http://propertycross.com/. The latter project allows you to compare different technologies for cross-platform mobile development.

The business logic of RemoteUI apps runs on a server while the UI is rendered by the client with native UI widgets. Therefore, RemoteUI apps have a great performance and require very low effort during development. Don't believe it? Compare the sources of this repository with the apps in the original PropertyCross repo (https://github.com/tastejs/PropertyCross). And remember: You only need a JDK and the RemoteUI Client (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.remoteui.client) for development.

## Try it

We have the app available for download in the playstore: <br>

## Build it

Sorry, at the moment, the app builds against the SNAPSHOT version of the RemoteUI App Framework that is not publicly available. As soon as we have the next stable release, you will see it here.
